# Ioke Tic Tac Toe

### Getting started with Ioke

* If you have Homebrew installed, then "brew install ioke" will get you
going.
* If you do not have Homebrew, you can find the binary [here](http://ioke.org/download.html)
* You can run an interactive Ioke prompt (called Iik) by typing "ioke" in your terminal. This command
  will also run any files that are passed to it.

### Running my Code

* Once you have cloned my code and got ioke up and running, run "ioke
  play.ik" from the project directory to play a game of Tic Tac Toe.
* To run the tests, run "ispec spec" from the project directory. The
  tests are using ISpec, the built-in testing framework, which follows
the RSpec model.
